#+DESCRIPTION:

The vision has been less acute than before since it was immersed in the
smog of this dirty town. My imagination shrank as the inspiration from
the vision of a wonderful world was gone. Lack of a clear visual
sensation turned the inner world into a plain playground. There, looking
up at the sky, I wondered how my life could be if I had a vision beyond
the smog.
